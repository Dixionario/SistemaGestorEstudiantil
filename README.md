# Sistema Gestor Estudiantil

This project is a **student management system in Java**, designed to model and manage people in an educational institution.

## 📌 Description
The system defines different types of people:
- **Estudiante** (Student)  
- **Profesor** (Teacher)  
- **Funcionario** (Staff)  

Each class includes attributes such as:
- Nombre (First Name)  
- Apellidos (Last Name)  
- Identificación (ID)  
- Dirección (Address)  

The file **Pruebas.java** creates instances of these classes and prints their information to the console.  
👉 This allows testing how the system stores and retrieves data from each type of person.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Java  
- **IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA  

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Open the project in **IntelliJ IDEA**.  
2. Navigate to the file `Pruebas.java`.  
3. Run the file → the console will display the created objects and their information.  

## 📚 Learning Purpose
This project was developed as a practice exercise to improve **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** skills, focusing on:
- Class design  
- Inheritance  
- Object instantiation
